# Esri Map Integration with Feature Layers and Widgets

This project showcases the integration of an Esri Map with multiple FeatureLayers, including thematic layers such as US State Boundaries, Forest Fires, and Emergency Response Centres. It also demonstrates the use of various widgets like Legend, Search, and LayerList within the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to enhance the interactive mapping experience.

## Features

- Utilization of the "dark-gray" basemap for enhanced visual contrast.
- Implementation of FeatureLayers to display US State Boundaries, Forest Fire occurrences, and Emergency Response Centres.
- Configuration of popup templates for informative click-through details on map features.
- Integration of the Legend widget to identify map symbols and layers.
- Addition of the Search widget for easy navigation and location finding.
- Deployment of the LayerList widget with legends to toggle visibility and understand map contents.

## Requirements

- An active internet connection for accessing the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and the map services.
- A web browser that supports modern web standards (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS).

## Usage

The map shows the Forest Fire that occured at different time period. Also, it shows the available Emergency Response Centre at different part of United States. All the layers are present over the United States Boundary Layer.
